# R_Project_NK_Missiles
Data visualisation project in RStudio, visualising the launch of missiles from the North Korean regime.

Code initially creates a range of visualisations and then cleans the most relevent to answer 3 key questions:
- How far are the missiles travelling and which of these missiles are travelling the furthest?
- How well are the missile tests going?
- How are the missile tests developing over time?
